# Hunt the Wumpus
A modern remake of the Hunt the Wumpus video game

## Description
Team VOID developed this program for the Hunt the Wumpus Challenge in 2024, which focuses on modern remakes of the original Gregory Yob Hunt the Wumpus video game. Our program features a better GUI, AI trivia components, custom art and music, as well as minigames.

### Main Algorithm
The main algorithm used to place EV Charging stations is DBSCAN point-clustering. Given a CSV database of all location POIs and vehicle hotspots (e.g., parking, fuel, etc.) extracted from an OSM file, the data points were initially clustered for centroid latitude and longitude points. Then, the raw points were adjusted to the nearest vehicle POI and assigned a weight based on the popularity of the point. The ID became the name of the vehicle POI or attached an ambiguous name.

### Diversity and Finalizing
To ensure diversity across the state rather than localized in POI hotspots, county boundary, income, and population data were factored in. Based on a threshold, the program calculates the amount of additional chargers to accommodate "diversity" counties, and points are locally clustered within the county. Finally, the remaining counties without any chargers are found (via ray-casting) and clustered for thoroughness. The combined points are adjusted again and written into a GeoPackage file.

## Dependencies
Most modules are within the Python Standard Library, but all imported modules are within requirements.txt
