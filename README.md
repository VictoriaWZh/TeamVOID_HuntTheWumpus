# Hunt the Wumpus
A modern remake of the Hunt the Wumpus video game

## Description
Team VOID developed this program for the Hunt the Wumpus Challenge in 2024, which focuses on modern remakes of the original Gregory Yob Hunt the Wumpus video game. Our program features a better GUI, AI trivia components, custom art and music, as well as minigames. We also have an accessibility feature for visually impaired or dyslexic people to do a TTS and STT version of the game.

## Dependencies
